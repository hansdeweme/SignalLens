# Activation criteria — lineage-aware scoring

## Current decision

**Do not replace production scoring.** The registry and structural shadow rules
are ready for diagnostic use, not a calibrated new forensic score model.
Default reference totals remain unchanged; optional composite-removal totals
are unvalidated experiments without confidence tiers.

## Structural correctness versus empirical weighting

| Work | Evidence required | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stable IDs, acyclic required/optional ancestry, no duplicate payload serialization | Direct source/contract inspection and deterministic tests | Implemented; all 20 current summary sections covered |
| Pure-restatement suppression | Actual counted ancestor, identical measurement ancestry and same hypothesis/target/polarity; explicitly no added observation | Implemented in shadow, tested with synthetic registries; no current audited detector falsely labeled equivalent |
| Missing-parent / unknown credit handling | Explicit availability contract | Positive base marginal credit withheld; unknown operation coverage explicit; production untouched |
| Counter-evidence preservation | Hypothesis-specific role and signed contribution tests | Implemented; existing supporting/contradicting/moderating/contextual lists copied without reinterpretation |
| Fractional credit for localization/interpretation | Evidence of conditional information gain and chosen numerical allocation | Not established; numerical marginal value remains null |
| Family caps / relative weights | Labeled cohort benchmark, sensitivity/false-positive tradeoff and calibration | Not implemented; no default coefficients or caps |
| Confidence/gate replacement | Validated dependency-aware gate and calibrated thresholds | Not implemented; existing gates remain authoritative |
| Source verification / image authenticity | Independent provenance/acquisition evidence | Not supplied by lineage; declarations remain unverified |

## Required conditions before any numerical activation

1. **Coverage and lineage review.** Confirm each new score-contributing pattern,
   optional payload, control and component rule is registered. No unknown
   positive credit may be silently presented as independent support. Document
   shared helpers separately from actual payload consumption. Preserve the
   snapshot alias/morphology integration distinction until explicitly resolved.
2. **Reproducible arithmetic.** Reconstruct each candidate aggregate from frozen
   base allocations, domain accounting, final component values and documented
   transforms within the existing 1e-12 tolerance. Repeated calls, shared inputs,
   insertion order and serialization must agree. No double addition of local,
   clone, camera or multi-family operation references.
3. **Preserve primary and counter-evidence.** Show that useful primary observations
   remain available and that related contradictory evidence retains its own
   hypothesis role. Demonstrate that descendants add no credit through missing
   measurements and that legitimate localization remains identifiable.
4. **Separate structural identity from statistical value.** Direct code reuse can
   justify a graph edge, not a learned coefficient. A pure restatement needs an
   explicit equivalence contract; family membership alone cannot justify zero
   weight. Any numeric marginal allocation or budget remains experimental until
   justified against data.
5. **Benchmark beyond two examples.** Use labeled authentic camera, smartphone,
   social-media recompression, conventional-edit, AI-enhanced, generated and local
   insertion cohorts. Include multiple generators/cameras/resolutions and mask
   quality regimes. Vary explicit/stripped/forged metadata independently of pixel
   content. Split by root image/source session/generator/camera groups to prevent
   variant and near-duplicate leakage. The detailed Phase 2B.1 proposal remains
   the collection design; no adequate benchmark is currently available here.
6. **Quantify error and incremental information.** Report per-hypothesis false
   positives, false negatives, precision/recall, coverage/abstention and intervals
   by cohort. Test conditional ablations and child information given parents,
   rather than only pairwise correlation or lower aggregate scores. Evaluate
   resizing/recompression and unseen generator/camera robustness. Report tier
   reliability; scores are not probabilities. Probability calibration metrics
   require an explicit probabilistic model first.
7. **Revalidate selection and thresholds.** A new aggregate has no right to reuse
   existing confidence thresholds. Evaluate pattern selection, provenance versus
   local-mechanism scope and mixed-unit corroboration gates on held-out data.
   Neither reference image is a mandatory target score/tier for a new formula.
8. **Explicit approval and rollback.** Version a proposed policy separately from
   lineage version `2b2`. Pre-register acceptance criteria and error budgets
   before examining held-out results. Activate only through a separately reviewed
   change; retain the old policy and reproducible traces. Do not rewrite saved
   historical analyses or automatically turn experiments into GUI decisions.

Rollback or stop evaluation if a graph cycle/unknown dependency appears, a
non-finite credit enters arithmetic, results depend on order, unavailable evidence
changes polarity, primary sensitivity is lost beyond an agreed bound, false
positives exceed the agreed cohort limit, or explanations claim independence
without evidence. These empirical bounds remain to be specified; none are
invented from the Instagram and Midjourney examples.

## Known limits of this implementation

- Numeric experimental allocations apply to base credits only. Existing boosts,
  synergies, camera moderation and penalty applicability remain fixed. This is
  conditional diagnostic accounting, not full causal propagation or retraining.
- Original domain diversity bonuses are preserved, not replaced by family counts.
  A family cap would be a further model change.
- A primary measurement ID means a distinguishable extraction, not an independent
  sample. Masks and preprocessing can create shared failure modes across families.
- The registry uses summary availability to describe actual feature availability;
  future detectors should expose explicit feature contracts if a valid summary
  does not reliably imply its upstream measurements existed.
- Status checks and mixed-unit production gate issues identified by Phase 2B.1
  are diagnosed, not silently repaired in this phase. No production confidence
  or routing change is included.
- Structural consistency does not authenticate metadata, validate a person mask
  against ground truth or establish forensic accuracy.
